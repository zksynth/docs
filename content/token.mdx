The $ZS token serves as the protocol ownership token for zkSynth. Holders of the $ZS token have the ability to participate in the governance of the protocol and share in its revenue.
One of the key benefits of holding $ZS tokens is the ability to vote on protocol decisions. Token holders can participate in on-chain governance and propose or vote on changes to the protocol. This allows the community to have a direct say in the direction of the protocol, ensuring that it remains decentralized and responsive to the needs of its users.

In addition to governance rights, $ZS token holders also have the ability to share in the protocol's revenue. 30% of the protocol's fees are distributed to $ZS token holders through a revenue-sharing mechanism. This allows token holders to earn a return on their investment and provides an incentive for them to hold and stake their tokens.
By holding $ZS tokens, individuals can be a part of the protocol's growth and development, and share in its success. The token-based governance and revenue-sharing mechanisms give holders a sense of ownership and control over the protocol. This helps to ensure that the protocol remains decentralized and responsive to the needs of its users.

## esZS 

esZS is an escrowed version of $ZS, which is used to incentivize liquidity providers on zkSynth. esZS tokens are redeeemable 1:1 for $ZS tokens after a lockup period. 
The lockup period is designed to incentivize liquidity providers to hold their tokens for a longer period of time, and to ensure that the protocol has a sufficient supply of $ZS tokens to support its growth and development.

#### WETH Rewards (Coming Soon)

Holding esZS would automatically accumulate WETH rewards. The rewards are calculated based on the amount of esZS held, and the amount of fees earned in the protocol. The rewards can be claimed at any time.

## Token Allocation

The token distribution of zkSynth, is designed to allocate the maximum supply of 1,000,000,000 ZS tokens to various stakeholders. The token allocation is as follows:

### Community

61.5% of the total supply is allocated to the community. This includes ecosystem rewards (30%), ecosystem development (4.2%), and a treasury (20%). The ecosystem rewards are intended to incentivize community participation, while the ecosystem development funds will be used to support the growth of the platform. The treasury will be used for future development and maintenance of the platform.

### Public

20% of the total supply is allocated to public, through presale and public round. This allocation recognizes the role of early investors in the success of the platform.

### Team and Early Contributors

Core team (12%), advisors (3.5%), and early strategic partners (3%) will receive 18.5% of the total supply. This allocation recognizes the role of the team and early contributors in the long term vision of zkSynth.
