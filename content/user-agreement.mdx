- Description of zkSynth Protocol. zkSynth is a DeFi protocol that allows users to issue and trade synthetic assets without slippage. Synthetic assets are derivatives that are created by putting other assets as collateral. You acknowledge that synthetic assets are a high-risk investment and may depeg due to bad debt if the underlying collateral loses its value quickly. The use of zkSynth is entirely at your own risk.
- Third-Party Service Providers. zkSynth relies on third-party service providers, such as price feeds, to operate. You acknowledge that zkSynth has no control over the actions of these service providers and cannot be held liable for any failures or disruptions in their services. You agree that zkSynth is not responsible for any losses that may result from the actions or inactions of third-party service providers.
- Security. The zkSynth protocol is built on smart contracts, which are subject to hacking and other security risks. You acknowledge that zkSynth is not responsible for any losses that may result from the exploitation of vulnerabilities in the protocol or smart contracts.
- User Data. zkSynth does not collect or store any user data beyond what is necessary for the operation of the Protocol. We respect your privacy and will not share your personal information with any third parties unless required by law.
- Targeted Ads. zkSynth does not display targeted ads or engage in any form of user tracking or profiling.
- Disclaimer of Liability. To the fullest extent permitted by law, zkSynth disclaims all liability for any losses, damages, or claims arising out of or related to your use of the zkSynth Protocol. This includes, but is not limited to, any losses resulting from the depegging of synthetic assets due to bad debt or changes in underlying collateral values.
- Modifications to User Agreement. zkSynth reserves the right to modify or update this Agreement at any time without prior notice. Your continued use of the zkSynth Protocol constitutes your acceptance of any such modifications or updates.
- Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which zkSynth is domiciled. Any disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be resolved exclusively through arbitration in accordance with the rules of the jurisdiction in which zkSynth is domiciled.
- Entire Agreement. This Agreement represents the entire understanding between you and zkSynth with respect to your use of the Protocol and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, whether written or oral.
By using the zkSynth Protocol, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Agreement and agree to be bound by its terms and conditions. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not use the zkSynth Protocol.
